There are (as of the last update) 4 sports to choose from for updating Menlo College's sports statistics document. Click on the sport that corresponds to the document you want to update. From there, you will have three options to choose from. The first option lets you navigate to the document you want to update. The second option lets you select where to save the updated document. And the third option is the convert button that begins the updating process. Once the program is done updating, the program will close, and you will be presented with a new document along with the original document.
